# BBUI - Better Blizzard User Interface

This addon is mainly created for my own usage but I gladly share it with the WoW community.

BBUI focuses on 3 things:

- **Clean up the default UI**: By simply moving or hiding some frames
- **Improve the game experience**: By adding minor features
- **Keep the addon simple and lightweight**

The addon is only **~10Ko memory usage on runtime** at the moment.

No settings planned.
